# Week 1 – Day 5

## What I did
- Created a shell script to check server health
- Script logs whether the server is UP or DOWN
- Logs are saved in a file

## Automation
- A cron job runs the script every 5 minutes
- Health status is checked automatically in the background

## Git Setup
- Used `.gitignore` to ignore logs and sensitive files
- Added a pre-commit hook to keep the repo clean

## Files
- `healthcheck.sh` – health check script
- `logs/health.log` – server status logs
- `logs/cron-debug.log` – cron execution logs
- `checksums.sha1` – file checksums
- `bundle-*.zip` – packaged project

## Note
- Server shows DOWN when nothing is running on the given port
- Monitoring only reports status, it does not start the server

Week 1 Day 5 completed.
