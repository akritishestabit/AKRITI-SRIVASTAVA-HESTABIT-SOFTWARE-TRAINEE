# Mini E-commerce Product Listing Page

This project is created as part of **Week 2 – Day 5 (Frontend Capstone Project)**.  
The main goal of this task was to combine **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and build a small but functional UI.

## About the Project

I built a mini e-commerce product listing page where products are fetched from an API and displayed dynamically.  
Users can search for products and sort them by price.

This project helped me understand how frontend concepts work together in a real-world scenario.
