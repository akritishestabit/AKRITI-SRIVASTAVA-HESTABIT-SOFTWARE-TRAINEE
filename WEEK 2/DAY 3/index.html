                    I am currently working as a Software Trainee at Hestabit, where I am
                    learning frontend and backend development concepts. My role involves
                    understanding real-world project workflows, writing clean code, and
                    improving my problem-solving skills.

                    During my training, I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and
                    Node.js fundamentals. I am also practicing building UI layouts,
                    working with DOM manipulation, and understanding how production-level
                    applications are structured.

                    This accordion project helps me understand JavaScript event handling,
                    DOM manipulation, and UI interaction without using any frameworks.
                    It improves my confidence in writing clean and maintainable
                    JavaScript code.
