# Week 3 – Purity UI Dashboard

This week I built a clean and modern dashboard UI using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

The main focus was understanding routing with the App Router and building modular, reusable components for a scalable UI.

## What I Built

- Sign In page  
- Sign Up page  
- Profile page

All components are structured in a modular way so that they can be reused and extended easily in future.
